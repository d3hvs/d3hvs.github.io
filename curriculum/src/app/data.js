I am a Front End Developer, self-taught. My skills have been learning following tutorials, video tutorials, documentation of technologies among other things. I mainly use javascript technologies such as ReactJS, Mongodb, Express. I'm taking experience using React Native for the development of mobile applications, since I've been developing an app in a start up for four months, the app is called Mobi. I have also explored to a lesser extent Vue.js, since being aware of new technologies and tools exist in the world of Javascript seems to me indispensable. Due to my professional training (not totally focused on programming by the university) I have been totally self-taught, so I was able to develop two web applications for a research group from the university from which I graduated, the University of Antioquia, which for confidentiality I can not mention, besides that they are of internal use. The only thing I can mention is that they were apps developed only with jquery on the front, due to group demands, and real-time apps using socke.io. I am Bioengineer, passionate about programming. Always curious to learn and see what comes out new that can improve the quality of my code and apps. I love sharing what I know, learning from others and contributing what I can. My learning has been a little dynamic, as I started in the web development world using jquery and django in the backend; that's about a year and a half ago, but since I met Node.js and all the power of Javascript I was fascinated and started to investigate and investigate, which ended up delighted by the development with this language in the frontend and backend. I tried a time Angular.js and although I liked the proposal of components seemed a little cumbersome, then I tried Angular 2, which I really did not like, because I felt that I lost a little freedom in development. Finally I tried React.js and I am completely happy to use this library, because I feel more advances and more taste for frontend development, besides I have already more than nine months of experience developing with React Native.
